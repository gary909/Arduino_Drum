  V3. * This version uses an imported Clap8bit.h and references it in the code.  This sample is not distorting

  V2. Uses Switch to chose between two audio samples - samples distorting, seems to be switching

  V1.  Uses sample imported into main code

  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 
   Example using a piezo to trigger an audio sample to play,
   and a knob to set the playback pitch,
   with Mozzi sonification library.

   Demonstrates one-shot samples and analog input for control.

   This example goes with a tutorial on the Mozzi site:
   http://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/learn/introductory-tutorial/

   The circuit:
     Audio output on digital pin 9 on a Uno or similar, or
    DAC/A14 on Teensy 3.1, or
     check the README or http://sensorium.github.com/Mozzi/

     Potentiometer connected to analog pin 0.
       Center pin of the potentiometer goes to the analog pin.
       Side pins of the potentiometer go to +5V and ground

     Piezo on analog pin 3:
       + connection of the piezo attached to the analog pin
       - connection of the piezo attached to ground
       1-megohm resistor between the analog pin and ground
